## Hi! Ready to cook?

Cook'n'JS is a simple yet powerful static website generator prototype. It's conceived to rely on a small subset of battle tested technologies yet able to be extended.

### Goals

- Provide a complete CLI (whisker) to deal with every task and need
- Clearly organized content and project structure
- Markdown pages, posts and articles (more on that division concept below)
- Allow to retrieve and serialize JSON and YAML datasets
- On the fly (re)generation of JSON schema from content
- Content abstraction layer
- Extendable
